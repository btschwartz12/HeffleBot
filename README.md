# HeffleBot

### By: Ben Schwartz

HeffleBot is an unfinished iOS Swift application that helps users find a nearby golf course based on their location. The goal of the app is to allow users to quickly find an available golf course when times are desperate, such as on a bad weather day. 

This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. However, please note that the project is unfinished and may require significant work to complete. 

To use HeffleBot, please clone the repository and run the app in Xcode. Since this project is incomplete, we cannot guarantee full functionality or support.
